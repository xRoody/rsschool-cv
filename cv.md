- ### About Me

  I am a second course student of SSTU. My education direction is Information systems and technologies.    
  The curriculum of my faculty includes more server-side technologies like Java then front-end technologies like html + css with JS.    
  This is the main reason I want to have a new experience (rs-school). I need to understand what is better for me back-end or front-end.
